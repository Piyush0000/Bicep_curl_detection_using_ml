# ðŸ’ª Bicep Curl Tracker using MediaPipe & OpenCV

This project uses **MediaPipe** and **OpenCV** to detect human poses and count **bicep curls** in real-time using your webcam. It's a basic implementation of pose estimation applied to fitness tracking.

## ðŸ“¸ Demo

The system uses pose landmarks to:
- Detect arm movement
- Calculate elbow angles
- Count full bicep curls

> âœ… Ideal for fitness beginners or developers learning computer vision with MediaPipe!

## ðŸ§  Features

- Real-time video capture using OpenCV
- Pose detection using MediaPipe
- Calculates elbow joint angle
- Counts bicep curls when the motion completes a full rep
